Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using SQL Server. The goal is to transform transactional data from the Northwind sample database into a structured data warehouse schema (Lab1) consisting of fact and dimension tables for analytics and reporting.

Objectives

Extract data from Northwind transactional tables.
Transform data using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for:

Calculated fields (e.g., LineItemTotal, DaysUntilRequired, DaysToShipped).
Data cleansing and handling null values.


Load transformed data into Lab1 schema tables:

Orders Fact Table
Product Dimension
Employee Dimension
Customer Dimension




Key Features

Fact Table (Orders):

Includes calculated metrics such as LineItemTotal and shipping timelines.
Primary key generated using OrderID and ROW_NUMBER() for uniqueness.


Dimension Tables:

ProductDim: Includes product details, category, and supplier info.
EmployeeDim: Includes employee demographics and job details.
CustomerDim: Includes customer contact and location details.


Methodologies Used:

ETL Pipeline Design
Data Modeling (Star Schema)
SQL Server CTEs and Joins
Data Quality Handling with ISNULL




Technologies

Database: SQL Server
Source: Northwind_TC database
Target: Lab1 schema
SQL Concepts: CTEs, Joins, DATEDIFF, ISNULL, CAST, ROW_NUMBER()


How to Run

Ensure Northwind_TC and Lab1 databases exist in your SQL Server instance.
Execute the script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

Creates CTEs for Orders, Products, Employees, and Customers.
Inserts transformed data into Lab1 tables.


Verify data in:

Lab1.dbo.Orders
Lab1.dbo.ProductDim
Lab1.dbo.EmployeeDim
Lab1.dbo.CustomerDim
